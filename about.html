    <h1>About LightPath9</h1>
    <p>
      LightPath9 was born from a single question: <em>Can generosity become a ritual?</em><br><br>
      In a world of fleeting transactions, we envisioned a platform where every act of giving becomes a visible flame ‚Äî a ripple in the cosmic stream. Rooted in sacred numbers, lunar rhythms, and symbolic design, LightPath9 invites ripple-makers to contribute not just money, but meaning.

    <h2>üåä The Ripple Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Every donation creates a ripple. Every ripple is honored, displayed, and celebrated. Flame tiers ‚Äî Spark, Ember, Flame, Torch, Beacon ‚Äî mark the journey of devotion. No act is too small. Each ripple joins a growing stream of light.

    <h2>üåô Cosmic Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      LightPath9 aligns with full moons, eclipses, and festivals. Our calendar is a living rhythm, guiding ripple-makers to give in harmony with the universe. Affirmations whisper encouragement. Notifications echo gratitude. Profiles reflect the sacred path of each donor.
